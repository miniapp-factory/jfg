```
2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid, with square numbered tiles that can be moved using the four onscreen arrow buttons. The arrow buttons are placed bellow the grid in the formation they usually appear on on a keyboard. The game begins with two tiles already in the grid, having a value of either 2 or 4, and another such tile appears in a random empty space after each turn. Tiles with a value of 2 appear 90% of the time, and tiles with a value of 4 appear 10% of the time. Tiles slide as far as possible in the pressed arrow's direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.

If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two. A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is equal to the sum of all tiles currently on the board.

The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board. Players can continue beyond that to reach higher scores. When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.

The user should be able to share their score once the game is over.

Place the 2048 game on the home page.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files will need to be edited or added to implement the 2048 game, generate the app logo, and update the metadata:

- `mini-app/app/page.tsx`
- `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`
- `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`  *(new file)*
- `mini-app/components/2048.tsx`   *(new file)*

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

A stylized, colorful logo featuring the number "2048" in bold, modern typography. The background is a gradient from deep blue at the top to bright teal at the bottom, giving a dynamic, energetic feel. The number is centered, with subtle glowing edges and a slight 3D shadow to make it pop. The overall design is clean, minimal, and instantly recognizable as a game logo.
